# IntSet-ADT
ADT that implements a set of integers. The underlying implementation uses a boolean array and the subscript indices to store/manipulate sets.
The typescript file shows the expected output from running the valgrind output on the executable. 

To compile & run (on linux):

g++ driver.cpp intset.cpp 
(OPTIONAL) valgrind ./a.out


DISCLAIMER: This was a school project for UW-Bothell related coursework. I implemented all methods and constructors but did not come up with the idea.
